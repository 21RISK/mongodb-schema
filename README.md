mongodb-schema
==============

Infer probabilistic schema of javascript objects or a MongoDB collection. 

This package is dual-purpose. It serves as a [node.js module](#usage-with-nodejs) and can also be used in the [MongoDB](#usage-with-mongodb) shell directly, where it extends the `DBCollection` shell object.

_mongodb-schema_ is an early prototype. Use at your own risk.

## Usage with Node.js

### Installation
Install the script with:

```
npm install mongodb-schema
```

### Usage 

Load the module and use call `schema( documents, options, callback )`, which will call `callback(err, res)` with an error or the result once it's done analysing the documents.

```js
var schema = require('mongodb-schema');

// define some documents
var documents = [
    {a: 1},
    {a: {b: "hello"}}
];

// define options
var options = {flat: true};

// define callback function
var callback = function(err, res) {
    // handle error
    if (err) {
        return console.error( err );
    }
    // else pretty print to console
    console.log( JSON.stringify( res, null, '\t' ) );
}

// put it all together
schema( documents, options, callback );
```

This would output:
```json
{
    "$count": 2,
    "a": {
        "$count": 2,
        "$type": {
            "number": 1,
            "object": 1
        },
        "$prob": 1
    },
    "a.b": {
        "$count": 1,
        "$type": "string",
        "$prob": 0.5
    }
}
```

## Usage with MongoDB

### Installation

There are two ways to load the script, one-time (if you just want to test how it works) and permanent (for frequent use).

#### 1. Load the script directly (one-time usage)

Call the `mongo` shell this command: 

```
mongo <basepath>/lib/mongodb-schema.js --shell
```

It will first load `mongodb-schema.js` and the open the shell as usual. You will have to add the script every time you open the shell. Replace the `<basepath>` part with the actual path where the `mongodb-schema` folder is located.

#### 2. Load the script via the `.mongorc.js` file (permanent usage)

You can also add the following line to your `~/.mongorc.js` file to always load the file on shell startup (unless started with `--norc`):

```js
load('<basepath>/lib/mongodb-schema.js')
```

Replace the `<basepath>` part with the actual path where the `mongodb-schema` folder is located.


### Usage

##### Basic Usage

The script extends the `DBCollection` object to have another new method: `.schema()`. On a collection called `foo`, run it with:

```js
db.foo.schema()
```

This will use the first 100 (by default) documents from the collection and calculate a probabilistic schema based on these documents.

##### Usage with options

You can pass in an options object into the `.schema()` method. See [Options]() below. Example:

```js
db.foo.schema( {samples: 20, flat: true} )
```

This will use the first 20 documents to calculate the schema and return the schema as flat object (all fields are collapsed to the top with dot-notation). See the [Examples](#examples) section below for nested vs. flat schemata. 

<br>

## Schema Format

The schema format is in JSON, and the shape resembles the shape of a superposition of all inferred documents. Each level of the schema (from the root level down into each nested sub-document) has annotations with special meta-variables, which by default start with a `$`. Examples of such annotations are `$count`, `$type`, etc.

### Example

Here's a first example, created from a set of 3 documents: 
```js

schema([ 
  {"a": 1, "b": "foo", "c": {"d": null, "e": 4.3}},
  {"a": 2, "b": "bar"},
  {"a": 3, "b": "baz", "c": {"d": "boo", "e": 2.9}}
])

// output
{
    "$count": 3,
    "a": {
        "$count": 3,
        "$type": "number",
        "$prob": 1
    },
    "b": {
        "$count": 3,
        "$type": "string",
        "$prob": 1
    },
    "c": {
        "$count": 2,
        "d": {
            "$count": 2,
            "$type": {
                "null": 1,
                "string": 1
            },
            "$prob": 1
        },
        "e": {
            "$count": 2,
            "$type": "number",
            "$prob": 1
        },
        "$prob": 0.6666666666666666
    }
}
```

A lot going on here already. There is a top-level `$count`, that just counts all the parsed documents. Each of the first-level sub-documents `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"` get their own section in the schema, just as if all documents were superimposed on top of each other (think "transparent slides"). Each sub-document has a `$count` of its own, together with `$type` information and a probability `$prob`. These fields are explained below. 

### Flat Format

If you pass in the option `{flat: true}` as second parameter to `schema`, every sub-level is flattened down to the root level, using dot-notation. Here is the same schema as above, but with the flat option:

```js
{
    "$count": 3,
    "a": {
        "$count": 3,
        "$type": "number",
        "$prob": 1
    },
    "b": {
        "$count": 3,
        "$type": "string",
        "$prob": 1
    },
    "c": {
        "$count": 2,
        "$prob": 0.6666666666666666
    },
    "c.d": {
        "$count": 2,
        "$type": {
            "null": 1,
            "string": 1
        },
        "$prob": 1
    },
    "c.e": {
        "$count": 2,
        "$type": "number",
        "$prob": 1
    }
}
```

Notice how the `"c"` sub-document doesn't contain information about its sub fields `"d"` and `"e"`. This is now tracked separate under `"c.d"` and `"d.e"`.

### Data Inference

You can enable data inference mode with the `{data: true}` option. The schema analyser will then gather statistics of your data for each field. The kind of information that is collected depends on the data type.


##### Numbers and Dates

For numbers and dates, you will get a `min` and `max` value of all the documents seen. Example:
```js
schema([ 
    {"a": 2}, {"a": 8}, {"a": 1}, {"a": 7}
], {data: true})

// output
{
    "$count": 4,
    "a": {
        "$count": 4,
        "$type": "number",
        "$data": {
            "min": 1,
            "max": 8
        },
        "$prob": 1
    }
}
```

#### Strings

When you enable data inference, the `string` type is replaced by either `text` or `category`, depending on the string values. 

If there are at least 2 string values and all the strings are unique, the type will be set to `text`, indicating that the field is likely some kind of free text field (a description for example). `text` types currently don't have a `$data` field and don't output any kind of data statistics.

If some of the string values repeat, the type is set to `category`. In that case, the `$data` field contains a histogram of how often each category was observed. The maximum cardinality is set to 100. If there are more categories than this value, an `$other` field counter will instead be increased. This is limit the amount of memory needed to keep the histogram stats. The maximum cardinality can be configured with the `data.maxCardinality` value. Instead of assigning `true` to the data option, you can pass in a sub-document to set the maximum cardinality:

Example:

```js
schema([
    {a: "a"}, {a: "a"}, {a: "b"}, {a: "c"}, {a: "d"}, {a: "e"}, {a: "f"}
], { data: { maxCardinality: 3 }});

// output
{
    "$count": 7,
    "a": {
        "$count": 7,
        "$type": "category",
        "$data": {
            "a": 2,
            "b": 1,
            "c": 1,
            "$other": 3
        },
        "$prob": 1
    }
}
```


#### Counts and Probabilities

The schema keeps count of the number of documents and sub-documents on each level. This information is stored in the `$count` field. If we pass in a single empty document `{}`, the output is this: 

```json
{   
    "$count": 1,
}
```

Passing in a document with a field `{a: 1}` returns this schema:

```json
{   
    "$count": 1,
    "a": {
        "$count": 1,
        "$type": "number",
        "$prob": 1
    }
}
```

The `"a"` sub-document receives its own `$count` field and only counts the number of occurences where the the `"a"` sub-document was present. Another example, for this list of documents: `[ {a: 1}, {b: 1}, {a: 0}, {a: 2}, {b: 5} ]`:

```json
{
    "$count": 5,
    "a": {
        "$count": 3,
        "$type": "number",
        "$prob": 0.6
    },
    "b": {
        "$count": 2,
        "$type": "number",
        "$prob": 0.4
    }
}
```

We can see a total of 5 documents (top-level `"$count"`) and `"a"` was present 3 times, `"b"` twice. 
<br>

Additionally, the schema contains a `$prob` value, indicating the relative probability for a sub-document given its parent document. 

#### Array Collapsing

Arrays are not handled as a distinct data type. Instead, they are collapsed and interpreted as individual values for the given field. This is similar to how MongoDB treats arrays in context of querying: `db.coll.find({a: 1})` will match documents like `{a: [1, 4, 9]}`.

Because each value of the array is treated as a separate instance of the sub-document, this affects the statistics like `$count` and `$prob`, and you can end up with a probability larger than 1, as it represents the average length of the array. 

To indentify a schema with a collapsed array field, the `$array` flag is set to `true` if at least one array was collapsed for a given field.

Example:

```js
schema([
    {a: [1, 2, 3, 4]}, 
    {a: [5, 6]}
])

// output
{
    "$count": 2,
    "a": {
        "$count": 6,
        "$type": "number",
        "$array": true,
        "$prob": 3
    }
}
```


#### Meta Variables

By default, the meta variables used to present schema data are prefixed with a `$` symbol. The individual meta variables are:

- `$count`
- `$prob`
- `$type`
- `$data`
- `$array`
- `$other`

The reason for the `$`-prefix is to distinguish any meta fields from actual data fields. MongoDB's drivers prevent $-prefixed keys to be written to the server, therefore we can be sure not to overwrite any user data. 

However, if the schema is going to be stored in MongoDB itself, then the names have to change, for above reasons. This can be achieved with the `metavars` option. Here is an example: 

```js

schema([
    {a: 1},
    {a: [-2, -3]}
], { 
    data: true, 
    metavars: { 
        count: '#count', 
        type: '#type', 
        data: '#data', 
        array: '#array', 
        prob: '#prob' 
    } 
})

// output
{
    "#count": 2,
    "a": {
        "#count": 3,
        "#type": "number",
        "#data": {
            "min": -3,
            "max": 1
        },
        "#array": true,
        "#prob": 1.5
    }
}
```


#### Merge Existing Schema

Sometimes you want to merge an existing schema with some new data. In that case, you can pass in the existing schema, and it will be amended with the new data. Use the `merge` option to pass in an existing schema, like so:

```js
schema( documents, {merge: myExistingSchema} )
```
