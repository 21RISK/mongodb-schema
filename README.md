# mongodb-schema

Infer probabilistic schema of javascript objects or a MongoDB collection.

## Todo

- [x] another pass at improving data structures
- [ ] rename fields -> properties like json schema.
- [ ] nested objects and arrays (will essentially make the Object/Array type models what schema model is currently)
- [ ] get sample dataset for test fixures
- [ ] update bin/mongodb-schema.js to do something real
